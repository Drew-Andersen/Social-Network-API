## Description
This application is the start of a full stack social network application using MongoDB, Express.js routing, and the Mongoose. All of the initial routes have been created allowing users to create a user, thought, and reaction. They can also be updated and deleted as well. 

## Installation
1. Clone down the repository to your local machine.

2. Open in VS Code. If you do not have VS code you must install it.

3. Using the terminal, install node.js. 

4. Once node.js is installed, use the terminal to run the command npm i to install the dependencies associated with this application (developers may need to install dependencies directly from the command line).

5. Next, you will want to make sure you have access to a MongoDB account and MongoDB Compass, these will allow you to interact with the database and visually confirm what changes are being made in the database. 

6. Once all dependencies are installed, you will then be able to run the command npm run seed && npm start from the root directory to spin up the server.
